<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deformable Mirror Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Segmented Mirrors</li><li>Continuous Surface Mirrors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The deformable mirror market is divided into two main types: segmented mirrors and continuous surface mirrors. Segmented mirrors consist of multiple discrete segments that can be independently adjusted, allowing for adaptive optics applications in telescopes and imaging systems. Continuous surface mirrors, on the other hand, feature a uniformly smooth surface that can be deformed continuously across its entire area, providing high resolution and precise wavefront correction in applications like laser communications and astronomy. Both types enhance optical performance by correcting aberrations.</p></p>
