<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Positive Displacement Pipettes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incomplete Outflow Type</li><li>Complete Outflow Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The positive displacement pipette market comprises two main types: incomplete outflow type and complete outflow type. Incomplete outflow pipettes retain a small volume of liquid in the tip, leading to potential inaccuracies in measurements. In contrast, complete outflow pipettes ensure full expulsion of liquids, providing more precise volume transfers. Each type is suited for specific applications, with complete outflow pipettes often preferred in analytical settings where accuracy is crucial, while incomplete outflow pipettes may be used for less critical tasks.</p></p>
