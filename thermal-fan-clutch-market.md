<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Fan Clutch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reverse Rotation</li><li>Standard Rotation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermal fan clutch market is segmented into two primary types: reverse rotation and standard rotation. Reverse rotation fan clutches are designed for applications where the fan must rotate in the opposite direction to the engine's normal rotational direction, often found in specific engine configurations. In contrast, standard rotation fan clutches operate in the typical direction, facilitating optimal cooling in most conventional vehicles. Demand for each type depends on vehicle design, engine specifications, and cooling efficiency requirements.</p></p>
