<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Foldable IOL Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Refractive Type</li><li>Diffraction Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The foldable intraocular lens (IOL) market consists primarily of two types: refractive and diffraction lenses. Refractive IOLs utilize shapes to focus light, providing clear vision at one or multiple distances, making them popular for cataract surgery and presbyopia correction. On the other hand, diffraction IOLs rely on micro-structured surfaces that manipulate light through diffraction, allowing for multifocal vision by enabling better light distribution across different focal points. Both types aim to enhance visual outcomes for patients post-surgery.</p></p>
